DeepLeafNet primarily uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology for
phytopathology diagnosis. Specifically, I used RESNET9 for this project which uses a combination of multiple convolutional and
pooling layers to extract features from input leaf images. The feature maps are then
passed through a final dense layer for classification. The network is trained using a large
dataset of leaf images, including different types of diseases and environmental stresses.
Additionally, it may incorporate other technologies such as image processing and computer
vision techniques to preprocess the input images and improve the accuracy of the
classification.
